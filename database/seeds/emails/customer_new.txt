<p>You are now officially registered as a customer on the {{app_business_name}} electronic portal.</p>

<p>
Because different service providers make use of the {{app_business_name}} electronic portal, it might happen that
more than one service provider registers you as a customer. If the latter is the case, you will be prompted to select
a service provider account after logging into your account customer account.
<p>

<p>
As an example, if you are a customer at ABC Holdings, you will be redirected to the ABC Holdings interface right away.
But if you are for instance registered as a customer at ABC Holdings as well as at XYZ Consulting, assuming both companies
make use of the {{app_business_name}} electronic portal, you will be given the choice to select which provider interface
you want to access, after you have logged in.
