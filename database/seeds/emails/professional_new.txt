<ul>
<li>
Location planner - In order to receive appointment requests from the public portal, you HAVE to update your location planner.
Your location planner is located in your control panel under Public Portal > Location Planner.
</li>
<li>
Your calendar interval decides how to present time slots. For example, every 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15, 30 or 60 minutes.
Your agenda interval can ONLY be changed for as long as you have no appointments. We recommend that you update your calendar
interval now.
</li>
<li>
You can only schedule appointments from your control panel. If you want to allow users to schedule appointments by themselves, you have to complete
your "public profile" once logged in. This will also list you on the {{app_business_name}} search portal.
</li>
<li>
If you activate your public profile, take note that the default status of ALL appointments made from the outside world, is PENDING.
You have to accept all appointments not scheduled from your dedicated control panel.
